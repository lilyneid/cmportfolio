## My Work

Over the weeks of this course, I've created various projects in many formats, both digital and physical. These are what I consider to be the best of my work this semester.

- [Rock Investigation](twine.html): A Twine project about the familiar situation of having no idea what you're supposed to be doing and making silly mistakes in a professional situation. Takes about 5 minutes to complete.

- [First Pages](firstpages.html): A Bitsy project about the anxiety of beginning things and making your own art. Takes about 5 minutes to complete.

- [Click Eden](clickeden.html): A simple p5.js project about poetry and how art creates beautiful gardens of knowledge in our minds. You can play with this one for as long as you like!

## This Project

The penultimate project for this class is creating a Github repository. As you might have figured out, that's what you're looking at right now!

This project was surprisingly easy once I got the hang of it. Of course, I hit more than a few snags. There were times I had to pause the video in order to troubleshoot something that had gone wrong on my end. I've learned, however, that these issues are just part of the process of digital making. 

The most important part of this project is that it taught me how to use Github, something I've been trying to do myself for a long time to no avail. This entire class has opened up many different avenues for creating and hosting my work that I was unaware of before.
